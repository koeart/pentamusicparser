The idea behind this project is, to automate my workflow a little bit:
After each show I end up with a playlist (extended m3u) and a txt file created in an etherpad.

I want to create a tar file from my m3u playlist, this functionality is covered by m3uparser.py

I also want to parse my txt file for certain keywords (such as <link ...>...</link>, <song>...</song> and so on and so forth. From this I want to create my shownotes via (for example) xls.

In later Versions I hope to be able to freely configure my parser: Depending on options given and a configuration file, different output shall be created, different tags shall be scanned for and so on and so forth.

I'm always thankful for comments improving my code (which is, right now, quite simple and dumb).

For comments use this github page or write to @koeart@identi.ca
